While other Academy recognitions honor members for outstanding achievement in a single area (e.g., teaching excellence, outstanding research, and distinguished service), the designation of Fellow is for a lifetime of achievement in the advancement of advertising scholarship, education, and service to the discipline. Thus, the Fellow is the Academy's broadest and most prestigious honor.

JCIRA had been a notable publication for advertising scholarship for over three decades. After a year's hiatus, it resumed publication in 2012. Since then, we have awarded a best paper award. The Chair of the AAA Publications Committee tabulates nominations from Journal reviewers and prepares a list which is then voted on by Publications Committee members. Authors are honored with a $500 check and a plaque during the annual AAA Conference.</p>
